@node Overview
@chapter Overview
FoxtrotGPS is a GTK+ based mapping and GPS application. It's typically
used to show a moving map showing your position in real time. It's
useful as a navigation tool, and as a track logging (e.g. for OpenStreetMap)
and trip planning tool.

By default, FoxtrotGPS uses maps from OpenStreetMap, but may use a
range of other maps, some in experimental mode.

@ifnotinfo
@center @image{screenshots/main-window, 3in}
@end ifnotinfo

Clicking anywhere on the map pops up a menu of common operations,
allowing such things as:

@itemize @bullet
@item identifying the exact coordinates of that spot
@item distances to another spot
@item setting way points
@item downloading map data in bulk
@end itemize

Click and drag the map to pan. As you do so, FoxtrotGPS will download
the necessary map data and display it. That map data is cached
(usually in @file{~/Maps}) and reused when required.

There are also a number of keyboard shortcuts defined
(@pxref{Keyboard Shortcuts}).

FoxtrotGPS also has some features that require other software to be
installed (@pxref{Geotagging Photos}) and other features that
can be enhanced by other software (@pxref{POI Icons}).

@node Connect a GPS
@section Connect a GPS
Many devices already have a GPS built in but if yours does not or you
want to have it in a better position to `see the sky' then an external
GPS is required. FoxtrotGPS uses @url{http://catb.org/gpsd/, gpsd} to
handle the varity of GPS hardware available, it's well documented and
readily available wherever FoxtrotGPS is likely to be used. Actual
GPS hardware options include:

@table @b
@item Handheld GPS
Typically used in bush walking, hiking etc. Connected via a serial or
USB cable, many newer laptops don't have serial ports anymore so a
USB-to-serial adapter may be needed. If you already have a hand-held, this
is a reasonable solution; you will need it on the car's dash, and might
need to stop it sliding around. Reception might not be great
especially in difficult conditions but you will probably be OK most of
the time.

@item GPS Mice
All mice have a pretty good sense of direction but some carefully bred
mice can be trained to convert that knowledge into the NMEA sentences
that GPSD expects.

A @url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/@/GPS_navigation_device#GPS_modules,
GPS Mouse} might be a better solution in many cases. Reasonably cheap,
powered from the laptop they have the advantage of being suitable to
sit on the roof of your car making for better reception.

@node Keyboard Shortcuts
@section Keyboard Shortcuts
There are a number of keyboard shortcuts for common operations:

pan West, East, North, or South respectively

@item @kbd{I}, @kbd{O}
zoom in, out

@item @kbd{A}

@item @kbd{1}-@kbd{8}

@item @kbd{M}

@item @kbd{Ctrl+T}

@item @kbd{R}

@item @kbd{Ctrl+P}

@item @key{F11}

@end table

@node Geotagging Photos
@section Geotagging Photos
FoxtrotGPS can be used to geotag photographs that were taken while
logging a GPS track, and can show icons on the map indicating
where the photographs were taken; this is done by correlating
timestamps in JPEG EXIF data with timestamps in the GPS track,
and the following additional packages must also be installed
for use at run-time in order to make use of this feature:

@itemize
@item @url{http://freefoote.dview.net/linux_gpscorr.html, gpscorrelate}

@node POI Icons
@section POI Icons
FoxtrotGPS can load distinct icons for different POIs from the directory
@file{~/.foxtrotgps/poi-icons/}; and, if you have the `@command{mkvisualid}' command
from libvisualid installed, FoxtrotGPS can even generate distinctive icons
automatically. For more on libvisualid, see
@url{http://www.hackerposse.com/~rozzin/VisualIDs, its website}.

@node Cached Maps
@section Pre Load or Refresh the Cached Maps

FoxtrotGPS is quite smart when downloading maps. As you browse to an
area or change zoom level if the appropriate map tiles are in the
cache, they will be used. If not, FoxtrotGPS will attempt to download
them, if it fails (because, for example, you are off line), it does so
silently and tries to scale what ever tiles it does have. This
sometimes means you'll have blurry maps.

The solution is to download what you need before you go off line, just
browsing is one way but that gets you only the current zoom
level. Right clicking and selecting ``Map Download'' is often more
useful.

@ifnotinfo
@center @image{screenshots/map-download, 2in}
@end ifnotinfo

It's important to note that the download applies to the zoom level
immediately below the one you are currently on, so go up a level
before starting. It's sometimes useful to bring the window borders in a
little to restrict the total download (and save some time and
bandwidth), you don't have to download in full screen mode! Watch the
little progress message to the bottom left: when it drops back to just speed
and similar information, the download is done.

@node Logging Tracks
@section Log Tracks for OpenStreetMap
For most people, the most useful maps in FoxtrotGPS are from Open
Street Map (OSM). This is an open project to map the whole world and
most of its content is contributed by people recording information and
then contributing it to OSM. If you are using FoxtrotGPS in any sort
of mobile mode, you are probably ready to do your bit for this
worthwhile project. Please consider!

OSM needs all sorts of data added, we will look here at perhaps the
mainstream activity, recording a road and adding it to OSM's
database. This process has a couple of clear steps:

@enumerate
@item Record the track.
@item Download the area from OSM
@item Label the recorded track and add it to the downloaded area.
@item Upload the `changeset' to OSM.
@end enumerate

@ifnotinfo
@center @image{screenshots/tracking, 4in}
@end ifnotinfo

The first step, recording, is where FoxtrotGPS comes in. Releases of
FoxtrotGPS after 1.1.1 have a useful icon on the main screen (left
side) to start track logging; with older versions it's necessary to click
the top left ``Show Info'' icon to display the Control Panel, and possibly
scroll it left or right until you see the ``Enable Track Logging'' tick
box. In either case, start recording at the start of the road, stop at
the end. Remember your GPS will be several metres out so accuracy
greater than that is not essential.

FoxtrotGPS saves its logs in GPX format (with an extension introduced
by Garmin for some auxiliary data). These logs can be converted
to OSM and other formats using the widely-available
@url{http://www.gpsbabel.org/, gpsbabel utility}.@footnote{Prior
to version 1.1.0, FoxtrotGPS used its own log format; in case you
have any logs in this format, there are scripts included with FoxtrotGPS
that can convert those logs to GPX format, or to OSM format directly.}

After converting logs to OSM format, they will be importable into
tools like @url{http://josm.openstreetmap.de/, JOSM}.
But before you convert, make things a bit easier for yourself and
rename the road. Perhaps keep the date and use the road name and condition,
e.g.: @file{20121107_Jones_Street_track_gr3.gpx}.

The remaining stages are probably best documented on
@url{http://openstreetmap.org/, the OSM website}, but do remember to
mark your roads as ``source=survey'', the best source of OSM data.

@node Bugs
@appendix Bugs
@itemize @bullet
@item
FoxtrotGPS includes a URL for Google Satellite imagery in its
default list of map repositories for demonstration and testing purposes,
but Google Satellite URLs apparently expire due to their ``v=...'' parameter
needing to be incremented. In some cases, repository URLs that break
in this way cannot be fixed automatically when FoxtrotGPS is upgraded,
and must be fixed manually by the user.
