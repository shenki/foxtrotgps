This release of FoxtrotGPS includes several new features and bug-fixes;
notable changes since 1.0.1 include:

    * FoxtrotGPS's general support for translations has been expanded,
      and some new translations have also been introduced:

      - Serbian, thanks to Branco Majic
      - Japanese, thanks to Yoshizumi Endo

    * Tracks are now logged in GPX 1.1 format, extended with Garmin's
      `TrackPointExtension v2' XML extensions. The track-conversion scripts
      are still included, but expect them to be removed in a future
      release in favour of standard third-party GPX tools.

    * The Zephyr HxM heartrate-monitor support that Tobias Prousa wrote
      for tangoGPS 0.99.4 has been incorporated as an optional feature--
      built by default if BlueZ is detected.

    * POI categories (and subcategories) are now included for geocaching,
      thanks to Rick Richardson.

    * The `Map Download' dialog now allows the user to determine
      whether tiles that have already been cached should be
      re-downloaded, thanks to Mikael Berthe.

    * GConf schemas are now included. This means several things,
      but the most notable change for end users is that many
      of FoxtrotGPS's configurable parameters are now documented
      and can be inspected with the standard GConf tools
      even if they have not been set from within FoxtrotGPS.

    * The default Google Satellite URL that FoxtrotGPS provides
      for testing and demonstration has been updated to accomodate
      Google's removal of older imagery from their database.
      Note that existing users may have to edit their `Google Sat'
      repository settings and manually change "v=53" in the URL
      to "v=102".

    * A long-standing bug that could cause FoxtrotGPS to crash when
      loading GPX tracks has been fixed.

    * The friend-finder's message-listing is now correctly un-hidden
      when the user clicks on the "New Message. Click here" notice
      in the status-line.

    * FoxtrotGPS can now be built with Curl 7.21.8 and newer,
      thanks to Martin Jansa.



FoxtrotGPS 1.0.1 is a bug-fix release; issues resolved since 1.0.0 include:

    * Several translations were incomplete in FoxtrotGPS 1.0.0, but
      have now been completed; these are:

        - Hungarian, thanks to György Balló
        - Spanish, thanks to Dailos Franchy
        - French, thanks to Steve Petruzzello

    * A bug causing failed downloads to appear permanently stuck
      has been fixed, thanks to Mikael Berthe.

    * A bug causing large, fast tileset-downloads to hang the
      user interface has been fixed, also thanks to Mikael Berthe.

    * A crash triggered by slow hostname-resolution, found thanks to
      Timo Juhani Lindfors, has been fixed.

    * Several resource-leaks, found thanks to Alexandre Maret, have been fixed.

    * When friend-finder icons are updated to new positions, they are
      now correctly (and consistently) erased from the old positions.
      Thanks to Ben McCarthy for finding this bug.

    * FoxtrotGPS can now be built against libgps 2.96 to support
      use with gpsd 2.96, thanks to Gleb Smirnoff.

    * A standard "--version" command-line flag is now supported.

    * "foxtrotgps --help" no longer fails when no display is available.

    * Various holes in the documentation have been filled--including
      the creation of a HACKING guide for those interested in contributing,
      thanks to Brian H Wilson.



FoxtrotGPS 1.0.0 is the first stable release of FoxtrotGPS since branching
from tangoGPS.

The user-visible features and functionality of this release are very similar
to those of tangoGPS 0.99.3; FoxtrotGPS does, however, include several fixes
and enhancements:

    * There is now a manual included.

    * FoxtrotGPS does not wait for all downloads to complete before
      updating the display with new map-tiles.

    * Thanks to libgps, FoxtrotGPS supports both the new and old
      gpsd protocols transparently.

    * The gpsd server address can now be specified either by name or
      by IP address.

    * The saved gpsd host and port settings are used at startup,
      rather than defaulting back to `localhost:2947' after each restart.

    * Any pending `Load Track...' windows are no longer cancelled by
      geocoding.

    * A bug causing geotagging of photographs to fail for photographs
      taken near lines of latitude or longitude has been fixed.

    * Toolbars now have a style more consistent with other GTK+ applications.

    * The command option-parser has been replaced with a more
      standard and full-featured one:
      - The "-fullscreen" option has been replaced by a more standard
        "--fullscreen" option.
      - A "--display" option is now supported to specify which X11
        display to use.
      - A standard "--help" option is now supported as a means of
        enquiring as to basic information about the program and its
        invocation.

    * A new `detail-scaling' feature has been added to the main menu,
      allowing selection of `fewer/larger details' or `more/smaller details'.

    * GUI elements directing the user to `see tangogps.org for more details'
      have been removed.

    * Several popular utility-scripts are now bundled (see the `contrib'
      directory):
      - convert2gpx, a Perl script by Marcus Bauer that can be used to convert
        the native track-log format to GPX.
      - convert2osm, a Perl script by Marcus Bauer that can be used to convert
        the native track-log format to OpenStreetMap format.
      - georss2foxtrotgps-poi, a Python script by Paul Wise that reads
        GeoRSS points and inserts them into the FoxtrotGPS POI database.

Additionally, packagers and developers should note the following changes:

    * All user-visible references in the program to the package-name
      (including paths to icons and configuration-data) are defined in
      terms of the GNU-standard symbols, "PACKAGE" and "PACKAGE_NAME",
      for easy re-branding.

    * The internationalisation infrastructure has been updated and
      extended using intltool, and now supports translations in
      foxtrotgps.desktop.

    * Issues triggering warnings from the GNU Autotools and the C
      compiler have been have been fixed. It should now be possible to
      build using GCC with CFLAGS="-Wall -Werror".

    * All libraries on which FoxtrotGPS depends are now specifically
      probed by ./configure; the package should no longer fail to build
      following successful configuration.

    * An `autogen.sh' script hass been added to simplify bootstrapping
      the GNU Autotools-based build-infrastructure.

    * The output of the ./configure script's probes for depdencies has
      been made less confusing by naming each dependency as it is
      probed.

    * The GUI has been converted to GladeXML, and is dynamically
      loaded via libglade. A GladeXML UI definition can be specified
      from the command-line via a new "--gui" option.
