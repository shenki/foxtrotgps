This is the first release of FoxtrotGPS since branching from tangoGPS.
The user-visible features and functionality of this release very similar
to those of tangoGPS 0.99.3; FoxtrotGPS does, however, include several fixes
and enhancements:

    * There is now a manual included.

    * Thanks to libgps, FoxtrotGPS supports both the new and old
      gpsd protocols transparently.

    * The gpsd server address can now be specified either by name or
      by IP address.

    * The saved gpsd host and port settings are used at startup,
      rather than defaulting to `localhost:2947' after each restart.

    * Any pending `Load Track...' windows are no longer cancelled by
      geocoding.

    * A bug causing geotagging of photographs to fail for photographs
      taken near lines of latitude or longitude has been fixed.

    * Toolbars now have a style more consistent with other GTK+ applications.

    * The command option-parser has been replaced:
      - The "-fullscreen" option has been replaced by a more standard
        "--fullscreen" option.
      - A "--display" option is now supported to specify which X11
        display to use.
      - A standard "--help" option is now supported as a means of
        enquiring as to basic information about the program and its
        invocation.

    * A new `detail-scaling' feature has been added to the main menu,
      allowing selection of `fewer/larger details' or `more/smaller details'.

    * GUI elements directing the user to `see tangogps.org for more details'
      have been removed.


Additionally, packagers and developers should note the following changes:

    * All user-visible references in the program to the package-name
      (including paths to icons and configuration-data) are defined in
      terms of the GNU-standard symbols, "PACKAGE" and "PACKAGE_NAME",
      for easy re-branding.

    * The internationalisation infrastructure has been updated and
      extended using intltool, and now supports translations in
      foxtrotgps.desktop.

    * Issues triggering warnings from the GNU Autotools and the C
      compiler have been have been fixed. It should now be possible to
      build using GCC with CFLAGS="-Wall -Werror".

    * All libraries on which FoxtrotGPS depends are now specifically
      probed by ./configure; the package should no longer fail to build
      following successful configuration.

    * An `autogen.sh' script hass been added to simplify bootstrapping
      the GNU Autotools-based build-infrastructure.

    * The output of the ./configure script's probes for depdencies has
      been made less confusing by naming each dependency as it is
      probed.

    * The GUI has been converted to GladeXML, and is dynamically
      loaded via libglade. A GladeXML UI definition can be specified
      from the command-line via a new "--gui" option.
